{"data": "The occupants of the space pause and look up at him as he approaches, They eye him questioningly, from his paint stained t-shirt to his black cargo pants.\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d he offers to the blank stares. \u201cAmy- Amycus told me to stay here?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026are you even old enough to be in here?\u201d asks the blond, ~~incredulous~~.\n\n\u201c\u2026I am!\u201d Akio lies, having learnt from his previous conversation. It doesn\u2019t matter much. The two men clearly don\u2019t believe him and look at each other for a long moment.\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d the man ~~says~~ tiredly, swiping a hand down his face. \u201cSit.\u201d\n\nHe sits. \u201cI\u2019m Akio,\u201d he says again, because he was raised a polite young man. Probably. It\u2019s not coming to him very easily right now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Luca Brando,\u201d the blond responds, and nudges his silent friend in the side. \u201cThis is Leifr \u00c1sj\u00e1.\u201d\n\n\u201cAkio is an interesting name,\u201d says Leifr, not even wincing as Luca\u2019s elbow digs harshly into his side. \u201cYou\u2019re a Futaba?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr, yes,\u201d he responds, caught off-guard because these people are from the *most influential Families in the Empire. Why am I here.*\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luca turns seemingly distracted from tormenting his friend\u2019s organs. \u201cThe Futaba? You guys are still around?\u201d\n\nThis, sadly, is a normal reaction to hearing his family name. When it\u2019s recognized at all. \u201cYeah, um, we. We\u2019re mostly with the Doctors nowadays?\u201d\n\nLeifr nods along like randomly encountering a member of a dying clan is normal. \u201cI know a relative of yours. Futaba Masamichi?\u201d\n\nAkio pauses. Luca\u2019s elbow starts moving back in for a sneak attack. \u201cYeah that\u2019s. That\u2019s my brother.\u201d\n\nThe man nods and shoves his friend away without even looking. Luca sneers at him and steals his drink. Leifr just reaches over the counter, pulls out a bottle ** and a new glass and pours out a generous splash.\n\n\u201cRight. Army Doctor right?\u201d\n\nAkio nods, ~~distracted by the byplay~~. Luca chugs the drink in one shot and suddenly, Akio\u2019s hands feel very empty. \u201cAre- are you in the army?\u201d *Wait no, stupid question. Which \u00c1sj\u00e1 isn\u2019t in the army?*\n\n\u201cYeah. Your brother had to fix up most of my team couple of months ago. Never got to thank him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll uh. I\u2019ll pass it on.\u201d\n\nLeifr nods again and they lapse into an uneasy silence. Akio ~~wonders~~ whether Amycus will be coming back any time soon. He\u2019s vanished, sometime over the course of the conversation, along with Katja and Asahina. Hopefully he\u2019s not going to dump their bodies in a ditch for daring to disturb the sanctity of his adults-only bar.\n\nFor a time, Leifr and Luca just drink. ~~For all that Leifr seemed calm~~, he\u2019s drinking faster now, his sips turning into swallows, his gaze growing more distant. He finishes the glass and pours out more. Luca notices and frowns.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he turns to Akio. \u201cDoctors huh? You\u2019re going the same way as your big brother?\u201d\n\nAkio stiffens. \u201cEr no. Not. I\u2019m not really interested in that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d The blond asks, ~~seemingly intrigued~~. \u201cWhat do you want to do instead then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI uh,\u201d Akio swallows. His nails dig into his palms. \u201cI want to be. An artist. Actually.\u201d \n\nAt this Leifr looks up too. Luca blinks. \u201cAn artist? But you\u2019re from a Family. You\u2019re not joining one of the Factions?\u201d\n\nAkio clenched his fists together. \u201cWhy- why should I? You said it yourself. No one really knows the Futaba exist anymore anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you still had active members, dear. I certainly knew you *existed.*\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brothers are- my brothers are already with the Doctors. This generation of our family has already done its duty to. To the Empire!\u201d\n\nLuca leans back a little at Akio\u2019s vehemence. He turns to look at his friend. Leifr has, at this point, almost returned to his glass, but at Luca\u2019s burning stare, clears his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s just asking because he\u2019s curious. We\u2019re not judging you. It\u2019s fine if you want to draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight and it\u2019s not about any kind of duty either,\u201d A voice sounds from behind him. Akio almost gives himself whiplash, spinning in his seat and sees Amycus slipping into his spot behind the bar. \u201cThe Empire has never required anything from the Families that it doesn\u2019t require from any of its citizens. It\u2019s the Families themselves that insist on every member joining one of the Twelve Factions.\u201d\n\nLeifr nods in agreement. Amycus spots the bottle at his side and snatches it away with a glare. \u201cDon\u2019t make me cut you off too,\u201d he warns, and turns back to Akio as Leifr winces. Luca looks mildly relieved. \u201cI\u2019ve sent your friends home,\u201d the bartender tells him. \u201cThey were in no state to hang around.\u201d ~~Akio, well aware of this, tries to look worried. Judging by Amycus\u2019s eyeroll this does not work out for him.~~\n\n\u201cAnyway, Leifr\u2019s right. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being an artist.\u201d the teenager flinches.\n\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t,\u201d Luca adds. He smiles ~~in apology~~ when Akio looks back at him. \u201cI forget I can be a little\u2026 abrupt at times.\u201d\n\nAkio nods and tries to smile back. It doesn\u2019t matter, really, whether he had meant ~~it judgmentally~~ or not. He can\u2019t afford to offend the Brando family. His previous outburst was stupid. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everyone reacts like that.\u201d\n\nLeifr, having finished the last of his glass, ~~looks like he desperately wants to be more drunk but is trying not to show it.~~ \u201cWell\u2026 what do you do? Are you a painter? I\u2019ve heard something recently. Some kind of movement about using physical paints and canvas?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! That\u2019s uh- they\u2019re very cool- I went to an exhibition last week. I didn\u2019t know people even knew how to make the paints for that any more,\u201d Akio ~~enthuses~~. It\u2019s a wildly fascinating movement, going back to the natural paint and canvas supplies to bring one closer to their art. \u201cI\u2019m uh not involved in that but I do- I do want to try it out. I\u2019m. I like to draw. Comics.\u201d\n\n\u201cComics huh? Anything good?\u201d Amycus raises his eyebrows.\n\nAkio is about to say no, no he\u2019s just starting out, ~~when another of the bouts of bravery  that have been  carrying him through the evening takes over~~. \u201cUh do you- do you want to see? I have some with me. On my pad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Let\u2019s see it then.\u201d Akio prays his blush isn\u2019t visible in the yellow lightening and pulls his pad out of his pocket. The small transparent square is quickly unfolded into Akio\u2019s drawing pad and he swipes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh, it\u2019s not done yet but\u2026 it\u2019s about the hoverboard ban a few years back. When they said that hoverboards could only be used in\u2026 in certain areas.\u201d Naturally, it is at this point that Akio\u2019s motor control fails him. He accidentally enters his booklist, his homework folder and his social media before finally managing to tap his drawing app.\n\nLuca snorts, \u201cI remember that. By certain areas you mean the back end of nowhere right? You children were so upset they caused trouble for almost a *year*.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Leifr interjects. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this. What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you were out of the Capital around that time,\u201d Luca nods. \u201cSome long mission or the other. You remember right, Amycus?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the racing incident, then I remember alright. Vividly. In fact, it was in the air just a few streets away from here. I saw part of it from my window.\u201d\n\nLuca whistles. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve seen it. I was out too, on a business trip. Only got back in time for the aftermath.\u201d\n\nLeifr frowns. \u201cWhat exactly was *it*?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt, um, was basically a huge race,\u201d Akio interjects. He\u2019s finally managed to open the comic and pushes the tab along the counter to Amycus. He and Luca lean over it together. \u201cOn hoverboards. Hoverboard races were, uh pretty normal back then right, but they\u2019d usually warn the locals and the businesses in that street and get permission and everything. But, uh, that time, a bunch of hoverboarders got really drunk and\u2026 they decided to just race. In the street. And, uh, because it was someone\u2019s birthday, they wanted to make it interesting so\u2026 they raced around fifty feet in the air. I guess that\u2019s what Mr. Amycus saw.\u201d\n\nThe red-head snorts. \u201cJust Amycus thanks. And yeah, it was pretty wild. A bunch of kids just wobbling all over the place at breakneck speeds, midair. I thought I was seeing things. Also this is pretty hilarious, good job kid.\u201d\n\nAkio\u2019s face erupts in red. \u201cRight! Thank you um. Where was I?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drunk kids wanted to race in the air,\u201d Leifr reminds him. The corner of his mouth twitch, and Akio promptly wishes for death for the nth time this evening.\n\n\u201cUm, right, yeah. So basically, one of them lost control of their board and fell, and they hit a passerby in the street. Both of them had to be rushed to the hospital. It turned out that the person who got hit was, uh, pretty important, and his family made a huge fuss. So the Architects banned the use of hoverboards anywhere in the Capital except for\u2026 well the back end of nowhere, pretty much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah and this comic is pretty much what happened after,\u201d says Luca, sounding vastly entertained. \u201cExcept for a few details. Have you ever actually met the Warden in person? Because let me tell you, she does not think back on past crimes and laugh, holy shit. I\u2019m not sure she actually laughs at all. This version of her is immensely preferrable. I demand you make it reality this *instant*.\u201d\n\nAs Akio blue-screens over this mind-boggling statement, Leifr nods in thanks for the explanation, and gently nudges his friend aside to look at the comic. After a beat, a slow grin begins to curve his lips.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d He asks. \u201cI get that this is a parody, but did this really happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept for a few details like he said,\u201d Amycus chuckles. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone ever trying to sneak a hoverboard disguised as a giant rubber duck out of the wardens\u2019 headquarters, for example, but it was only a little less ridiculous than that.\u201d He pauses after a moment- he\u2019s spotted someone a little further down waving their hand - they want a refill. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to go. Give me a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did they stop it?\u201d Leifr asks as he leaves, no longer able to hold back his smile. Akio droops a bit, looking after the red-haired man and Luca snaps his fingers in front of his face- Akio comes back to himself with a jerk. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have repealed it? There haven\u2019t been as many kids flying around for a while, now that I think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell they couldn\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat person\u2026 could really have died so\u2026 They made designated areas and like aero-paths where it\u2019s okay to fly. Mostly areas with less people. Like\u2026 air-traffic, I guess. So things died down after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat old lady must have been shaking with rage,\u201d he  comments, leaning back in his seat. \n\n\u201cOh she was,\u201d Luca chuckles. \u201cI heard the wardens were trembling for days. Probably stung her pride, having to let them go, even a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe always did have an inflated ego,\u201d Leifr notes, and Akio is in awe for a moment, remembering that these people have actually *met* legendary figures like the Warden. Probably *still* meet them. Regularly. *I\u2019m not going to get in trouble for this right?*\n\n\u201cAh but kid,\u201d and Akio flinches just a little because the laughter has stopped and Luca\u2019s voice has gone serious and a little quiet. \u201cAre you planning on publishing this? Is the rest of your stuff like this? You\u2019re going to draw attention to yourself, and not the fun kind.\u201d\n\nAkio blinks. He *has* considered publishing. It\u2019s his dream. \u201cI\u2026 it\u2019s not that bad right? It portrays her in a positive light.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d Luca asks. Beside him, Leifr has stopped smiling too. \u201cIt\u2019s an incident in which she lost face. Leifr just said it - she has one hell of an ego. She won\u2019t care whether it was in a positive light or not. She\u2019s not going to like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI- I mean\u2026 well-\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should listen to Luca,\u201d Leifr murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m not as good with this kind of political maneuvering- but he\u2019s not been wrong before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s important,\u201d Akio stammers. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it was a serious incident at the time and\u2026 and you\u2019re right the wardens *did* mishandle it, just because the person involved was powerful. The wouldn\u2019t have cared at all if it was just an ordinary citizen. I\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings or- or draw *attention* but isn\u2019t it important? To draw attention to these things so we can do better? It- it *matters.*\u201d\n\nLuca and Leifr both look at him for a long moment. Amycus returns, wiping his hands on a washcloth and raises an eyebrow at the ~~suddenly chilled~~ atmosphere. \n\n\u201cSorry, am I interrupting something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leifr responds. \u201cAkio was just saying he wants to publish his comics.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Amycus blinks. His hands pause on the washcloth for a split second. Akio doesn\u2019t notice, but Leifr\u2019s eyes land there and his gaze grows heavier. \u201cWell, yes I suppose if you want to be an artist, publishing is the next step isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nLuca turns his stare on him and it grows colder, just a little. Amycus returns it steadily. \u201cIf you want,\u201d Amycus says, eyes still on Luca. \u201cI can put you in touch with some friends of mine. They run a newspaper. Nothing big, just a few hundred khryos, but there you go.\u201d\n\nAkio\u2026doesn\u2019t answer. He has the sudden feeling that he\u2019s lost control of the conversation, that what started with him showing off his art, has become something else. Something bigger. *You\u2019re going to draw attention to yourself*, Luca had said. *And not the fun kind.*\n\nAkio rubs his palms on his pants. They feel clammy, and cold in a way they haven\u2019t been since Amycus cut him off and made him sit at the bar. Leifr still isn\u2019t speaking, but he\u2019s turned to Akio and is watching him steadily. Luca\u2019s frowning hard. Akio looks up at the bartender. Amycus is looking at him. He\u2019s put the washcloth down and is leaning against the bar, arms crossed. He\u2019s waiting for Akio\u2019s answer.\n\nAkio ~~thinks~~ about his brothers, both Faction members, contributing to the Family. One of them has just been thanked by one of the most powerful, most decorated Families in the Empire. He ~~thinks~~ about his parents, about the disappointment in their eyes when they see him curled up in a corner with his drawing pad at a social event. He ~~thinks~~ about his peers, who aspire to be Vanguards, Wardens, Doctors, anything and everything except a pathetic, forgotten nobody.\n\nHe ~~thinks~~ about his mother, despairing, asking *Akio, can\u2019t you do something that* matters *for once?*\n\nHe looks into Amycus\u2019s eyes and knows, in that moment, that if he refuses, Amycus won\u2019t bring it up again. That they can continue the conversation like this never happened. His fists clench, scrunching up the material of his pants.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d"}
